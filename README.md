This project was built using Next.js version 15.1. I have used the App Router for building this project. It is a very simple car gallery. On the homepage, you can see a list of cars.

In this project, you can display cars based on categories.you can apply a filter to show cars within a specific price range.
Additionally, you can simultaneously apply filters based on both price and category.
The car details page is also accessible.ðŸ˜Š
